# Java CSE17 Assignments

This repository collects my programming assignments for **CSE 017: Programming and Data Structures**.  
It serves as a portfolio of my work in **Java**, covering foundational topics in computer science such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, and performance analysis.

└── cse17/
├── pa1/ # Media Manager (intro to OOP, classes, arrays)
├── pa5/ # Rational Numbers & Generic Utilities (generics, interfaces, comparators)
├── pa9/ # TreeMap & TreeSet (binary search trees, custom comparators)
└── pa10/ # HashMap Implementations (linear probing, separate chaining, performance testing)

## Highlights

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Implemented custom classes with encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
- **Generics and Interfaces**: Built type-safe utilities and comparator-based sorting mechanisms.  
- **Data Structures**: Designed and tested binary search trees, tree maps, tree sets, and hash maps.  
- **Algorithms**: Implemented searching, sorting (merge sort), and hash table collision strategies.  
- **Performance Analysis**: Compared runtime behavior (iterations, collisions, clustering) between linear probing and separate chaining hash maps.  
- **File I/O**: Processed structured datasets (e.g., `movies.csv`, `ratings.csv`) to analyze and sort real-world information.

## Technologies

- **Language:** Java  
- **Concepts:** Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, Generics, Collections Framework, Algorithm Analysis  
- **Development:** Command-line compilation (`javac`) and execution (`java`)

## Running the Code

Each assignment folder (`paX/`) includes its own `README.md` with build/run instructions.  
Typical usage follows:

```bash
# Compile
javac *.java

# Run
java Test

Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I strengthened my ability to:

Design efficient, reusable data structures.

Compare and analyze algorithmic trade-offs.

Work with real-world datasets and measure program performance.

Write clean, well-documented, and maintainable code.
